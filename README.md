FIBONACCI SEQUENCE


The second function, fib_seq, takes a number n and returns 
a Fibonacci list starting from zero and ending with the
nth term of the famous sequence. 

Ex) if n = 7, then the function will return

	[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]

    the first 7 terms of the Fibonacci sequence


The third function, approx_goldratio, uses the last two
terms of the Fibonacci sequence previously created to 
approximate the Golden Ratio. The higher n that is chosen, 
the larger the Fibonacci sequence will be and the closer
the approximation will be to the Golden Ratio. 

Ex) if n = 7, then the third function will return

	1.6
